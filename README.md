# 3D Hippocampus Voxel Coordinate Visualization

A python application created using Streamlit to visualize and edit hippocampus slice images by adding or deleting the points.

This project focuses on visualizing 3D hippocampus voxel coordinates, particularly those corresponding to the granule cell layer in the dentate gyrus region. The original dataset, containing voxel coordinates for various hippocampal regions, was provided in a .txt format and has been converted into an .xyz file.

The primary goal of this project is to generate 2D visualizations by slicing the point cloud along a constant z-axis value, resulting in x-y coordinate plots. These plots represent the centers of voxels within the granule cell layer, providing insights into the spatial distribution of this region.
